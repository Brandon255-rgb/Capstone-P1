		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			Hi! I’m Brandon van Vuuren, a passionate software engineer and lifelong
			technology enthusiast based in Cape Town, South Africa. With a background
			in Information Technology and over 3 years of hands-on experience in
			full-stack development, I specialise in building clean, scalable, and
			efficient applications across web and mobile platforms.
		</p>
		<p>
			From spearheading agile teams to crafting beautiful UIs and implementing
			RESTful APIs, I take pride in bridging the gap between design and
			functionality. My work ethic blends curiosity with discipline, and I
			constantly strive to stay at the forefront of tech innovations—especially
			in AI, automation, and cloud-native development.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I’m not writing code, you’ll find me jamming on the guitar, reading
			about behavioural psychology, or exploring the coastal trails with my dog,
			Pixel.
